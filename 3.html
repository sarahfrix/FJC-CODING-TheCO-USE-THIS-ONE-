          <h2> Frix Jennings Clinic History and Establishment </h2> 
          <h3> In 2001, the Frix - Jennings Clinic brought the highest caliber of healthcare to the people of Henderson and Chester County. Starting with zero patients, our clinic now sees and treats patients at six different clinic locations throughout southwest Tennessee. With over 50,000 patient encounters last year, our clinic has become one of the largest providers of primary healthcare services in Tennessee. 
          The Frix-Jennings Clinic has always offered the latest in healthcare technology to our patients. From day one, we have employed Practice Partner, a fully functional electronic medical record system, complete with scheduling, medical records, drug interaction, and billing modules. We have also invested in diagnostic and therapeutic ancillary services as patient volume has justified the capital expenditure. Starting with routine x-ray services and a small array of lab tests, the clinic would soon add a full range of laboratory equipment, becoming Chester County’s first and only Moderate Complexity CLIA Certified laboratory. Around 2003 the clinic purchased its first ultrasound unit. A DEXA scanner was purchased shortly thereafter. In 2005 an Accuspina spinal decompression unit was purchased which has successfully treated hundreds of patients with spinal disk disease, saving most of them from surgical intervention – indeed, this technology has been so successful we provide these treatments at every Frix-Jennings Clinic location.

              The lack of a hospital in Chester County has been the driving force behind much of the technology and many of the services provided by our clinic. In 2005, our clinic purchased a single slice CT scanner  - the first (and only) in Chester County. Since that time, our clinic has upgraded to 4-Slice, 16-Slice, and ultimately a 64-Slice CT scanner, allowing us to provide many emergency room type services to our patients at a great value.
              Our investment in technology would not stop there. On August 26, 2009, the State of Tennessee awarded our clinic a Certificate-of-Need (CON) for an MRI scanner, the first ever for a primary care practice in Tennessee. 
              Ultimately, this commitment to technology combined with highly experienced healthcare providers committed to providing excellent primary and urgent care services has resulted in a very unique healthcare organization providing healthcare of the highest caliber at great value to our patients.
